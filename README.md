**Random Quote Generator**

This project is a simple app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. The app is built using basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and object literals.

**How it Works**

The app randomly selects a quote from an array of quote objects and displays it on the screen when the "Show another quote" button is clicked. Each quote object in the array includes a quote and its source, and some objects also include citation, year, and tag properties.

**Project Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are:

Building the array of quote objects to store the quotes
Writing functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
This project is a fun and effective way to practice basic JavaScript skills while creating a simple interactive portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
